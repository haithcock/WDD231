Today im reading about favicons which is short for favorite icons. You link them in your webpage using "<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">"

Now im reading about meta tags which is used by twitter/X and facebook for the purpose of displays for either. twitter uses twitter:tittle" except now that its called X Chatgpt is telling me they now use standard HTML5 tags and open graph tags such as og:image, og:description, og:title.

Appaterently there is not harm in having extra meta tags. The only downside is a few exta bytes of data to load. 

Open graph tags: Without open graph tags, if your page is shared on FB then the facebook crawler uses internal hueristics to make a best guess about the title, description, and preview image for your content. 


I FINALLY GET CLASS MATERIAL ON JSON!!
    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It closely resembles javacript object literal syntax. 
    
    JSON IS AS FOLLOWS
        -Text based
        -Stored with the .json extension
        -closley paird to a literal JavaScript object and is converted to a native JavaScript Object.
        -NOT dependent on a particular programming language.
        -written in basic key value pairs
            SUCH AS 
                -key:pair data types of strings, numbers, arrays, booleans and other object literals.
        -pure property formatted data with zero methods.
        -can be accessed with basic javascript object notation
        -DOESNT ALLOW COMMENTS 
        -can be validated with linter like jsonlint.com for structure

        OBJECTS IN JSON ARE SEPERATED BY COMMAS WITHIN CURLY BRACKETS
