Today im reading about favicons which is short for favorite icons. You link them in your webpage using "<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">"

Now im reading about meta tags which is used by twitter/X and facebook for the purpose of displays for either. twitter uses twitter:tittle" except now that its called X Chatgpt is telling me they now use standard HTML5 tags and open graph tags such as og:image, og:description, og:title.

Appaterently there is not harm in having extra meta tags. The only downside is a few exta bytes of data to load.
